<h2>Speaking up</h2>
<p>Amanda Gorman. On Friday, the country's first youth poet laureate said she was racially profiled by a security guard. Gorman – who performed at President Biden's inauguration – said she was walking home when a security guard "demanded" she prove she lives at her building because she looked "suspicious." Gorman called it the "reality of Black girls" that they can be called an icon one day and a threat the next. And said she'll continue to fight for Black Americans who deal with discrimination every single day.</P>
